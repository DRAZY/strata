# Strata

A fast, open-source, keyboard-first text editor in the spirit of Sublime Text.

> Status: pre-alpha scaffold. Icon: `assets/icon.svg`.

## Goals

- Opens instantly; stays smooth on huge files (100 MB+).
- Multiple cursors, Goto Anything, command palette, split panes, minimap.
- Reads existing `.sublime-syntax` / `.tmTheme` grammars and color schemes so the
  ecosystem's community grammars work on day one.
- MIT-licensed, cross-platform (macOS, Linux, Windows).

## Clean-room rule

This project is **not** derived from Sublime Text's code, binaries, or bundled
assets. Read `docs/CLEAN_ROOM.md` before contributing.

## Proposed stack

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Core | Rust | Speed, memory safety, single binary |
| Text buffer | `ropey` | Rope with O(log n) edits on huge files |
| Highlighting | `syntect` | Reads `.sublime-syntax` + `.tmTheme` natively |
| Parsing (later) | `tree-sitter` | Structural selection, symbols |
| UI | `winit` + `wgpu` | GPU text rendering, Sublime-level responsiveness |
| Plugins | Lua or WASM | Sandboxed, embeddable |

See `docs/FEATURES.md` for the feature spec and roadmap.
